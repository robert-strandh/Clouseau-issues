This repository exists solely in order to create issues related to
Clouseau, the CLIM-based Common Lisp inspector.

Currently, Clouseau is distributed with McCLIM, the free
implementation of the CLIM II specification, and it is not practical
to create Clouseau-related issues in the McCLIM repository, because
they represent too much noise in the big picture of McCLIM.
